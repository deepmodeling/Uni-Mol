Uni-Mol is a universal 3D molecular pretraining framework that significantly enlarges the representation ability and application scope in drug design.

Uni-Mol is composed of two models: a molecular pretraining model trained by 209M molecular 3D conformations; a pocket pretraining model trained by 3M candidate protein pocket data. The two models are used independently for separate tasks, and are combined when used in protein-ligand binding tasks. 


## Data release 
We will later release the data we used in the pretraining and downstream tasks. 
## Code release 
We will release the source code in this repo.
