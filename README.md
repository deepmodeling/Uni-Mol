Uni-Mol is a universal 3D molecular pretraining framework that offers a significant expansion of representation capacity and application scope in drug design. The framework comprises two models: a molecular pretraining model that has been trained using 209M molecular 3D conformations, 
and a pocket pretraining model that has been trained using 3M candidate protein pocket data. These two models can be used independently for different tasks and are combined for protein-ligand binding tasks. Uni-Mol has demonstrated superior performance compared to the state-of-the-art (SOTA) in 14 out of 15 molecular property prediction tasks. Moreover, Uni-Mol has achieved exceptional accuracy in 3D spatial tasks, such as protein-ligand binding pose prediction and molecular conformation generation.

Uni-Mol+ is a model for quantum chemical property prediction. Firstly, given a 2D molecular graph, Uni-Mol+ generates an initial 3D conformation from inexpensive methods such as RDKit. Then, the initial conformation is iteratively optimized to its equilibrium conformation, and the optimized conformation is further used to predict the QC properties. In the PCQM4MV2 and OC20 bencmarks, Uni-Mol+ outperforms previous SOTA methods by a large margin.

Uni-Mol Docking V2: towards realistic and accurate binding pose prediction
--------------------------------------------------------------------
We update unimol docking to Uni-Mol Docking V2, which demonstrates a remarkable improvement in performance, accurately predicting the binding poses of 77+% of ligands in the PoseBusters benchmark with an RMSD value of less than 2.0 Ã…, and 75+\% passing all quality checks. This represents a significant increase from the 62% achieved by the previous Uni-Mol Docking model. Notably, our Uni-Mol Docking approach generates chemically accurate predictions, circumventing issues such as chirality inversions and steric
clashes that have plagued previous ML models.

Service of Uni-Mol Docking v2 is avaiable at https://bohrium.dp.tech/apps/unimoldockingv2
